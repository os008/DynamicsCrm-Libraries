### Version: 5.1.1
---

A collection of libraries for common and extended operations in Dynamics CRM development that gives power to the developer and saves time.

## Features

  + Massive JS and CS libraries of common and generic functions and classes
  + An extension to the out-of-the-box IOrganizationService
    + Automatic service pool/queue handling
    + Connection warmup to improve caching performance
    + Caching of operation results
    + Load balancer algorithms for multi-node environments
    + Automatic retry of failed operations
    + Deferred operations to run in a transaction
      + Accumulate operations from across the application to be executed in one go
    + Planned execution to be sent to CRM for execution
      + Return values from mid-execution operations can be used in later operations within the same transaction
  + Dynamics-CRM-specific code analysis rules
